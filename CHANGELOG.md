- **Automated PR Comments**: Posts detailed review results directly on pull requests
- **Merge Protection**: Blocks merges when critical violations are detected
- **Customizable Rules**: Easy configuration for project-specific requirements
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks code quality, complexity, duplication, and technical debt
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate feedback on code quality during development

### Documentation
- Detailed README with usage examples
- Installation guide with automatic project detection
- Configuration examples for different project types
- Best practices and anti-pattern examples
- Troubleshooting guide

### Workflows
- **AI Review Workflow**: Runs on all PRs to main/develop/master branches
- **Merge Guard Workflow**: Validates architecture before allowing merges
